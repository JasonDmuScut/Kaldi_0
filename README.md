#Kaldi_0


A book in Chinese for  the state of the art ASR technologies, the design and implementatoin with the Kaldi toolkit.

Several regularizations should be followed in the composition process:

(1) Open. We are open in suggestion, writing, error checking, and all aspects. Everyone interested in the project is welcome, 
and we hope to make the book a sum-of-intelligence of all people.

(2) Shallow. We hope to use the most easy way to describe the technology, particularly the motivation, the intuition, and the 
results. We hold the idea that: if you want more knowledge in depth, there are many other books you can check.

(3) Practical: We hope use this book, you can establish your own ASR/SID system, and get most of tips that help you improve.



Clone and open it in LaTeX, then compile `book.tex` to take all parts as a whole.
